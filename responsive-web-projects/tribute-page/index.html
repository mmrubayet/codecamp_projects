		<h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Islam's life:</h3>

			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1948</strong> - After the partition of British India, Islam's family moved to East Pakistan, Now Bangladesh. His family was based in Chittagong. He got <em>Double Promotion</em> while appearing admission test for fifth grade at Chittagong Collegiate School and College and promoted to sixth grade. While studying here, he developed a different love for mathematics. Continue to solve many additional geometries. He studied at Chittagong Collegiate School and College until ninth grade.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1951</strong> - After getting up in the ninth grade, he left East Pakistan and moved to West Pakistan. There he was admitted to Lawrence College. From this college he passed Senior Cambridge and Higher Senior Cambridge. At that time Senior Cambridge meant current O level and Higher Senior Cambridge meant current A level. At this time he used to calculate a lot by himself. He tried to solve problems from different books which came in handy later. Note that at Higher Senior Cambridge he studied mathematics alone. Not everyone wanted to take it because it was a pretty high level math. At this time he became weak towards mathematics.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1954</strong> - After finishing Lawrence College, he went to study at St. Xavier's College, Calcutta University. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1957</strong> - He received a BSc degree from St. Xavier's College. He mentioned one of the teachers of this college as his favorite teacher. The name of this teacher is "Father Gore". JN Islam became his fan because he could easily explain the complexities of mathematics.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1960</strong> He completed his Masters in 1960. As a student of the Trinity College, he finished the Mathematical Tripos.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1959</strong> - In 1959, at the age of 20, he graduated for the second time from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University.  Along with Stephen Hawking, he befriended Indian mathematician Narlika. Another classmate was Brian Josephson, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 at the age of 33 for his PhD thesis. He got his Honors in Functional Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. A three-year course, he completed it in two years.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1960</strong> - Completed his Masters in 1960. As a student of the Trinity College, he finished the Mathematical Tripos.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1968</strong> - Islam obtained his PhD in applied mathematics and theoretical physics from Trinity College, Cambridge
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>1969</strong> - After completing his PhD, he worked for two years at the University of Maryland in the United States. Also, worked as a teacher at the world-famous Caltech University in California and at the University of Washington.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1973</strong> - From 1973 to 1974 he was a lecturer in applied mathematics at King's College London.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1975</strong> - From 1975 to 1978 he was a Fellow of the Science Research Council at University College, Cardiff (now Cardiff University).
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1977</strong> - Wrote his renowned research article, <strong>Possible ultimate fate of the universe</strong>.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1978</strong> - He joined City University of London as a lecturer in 1978 and was later promoted to Reader.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1982</strong> - He obtained his DSC or Doctor of Science degree in 1982, a degree that very few scientists in the world have achieved. However, the success of this acclaimed professor in the academic arena was noticed long ago.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>1984</strong> - He has studied and researched in foreign lands, he has got better opportunities, but he never wanted to stay abroad permanently. So in 1974 he made a big decision. Leaving behind the lucrative job of millions of rupees in Britain, endless opportunities for research, and a secure life, he joined the University of Chittagong in Bangladesh as a professor for three thousand Taka.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1985</strong> - The Bangladesh Academy of Sciences awarded him the gold medal in 1985.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1994</strong> - In 1994, he received the National Science and Technology Medal.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>1998</strong> - In 1998, he was awarded the Medal Lecture Medal at the Third World Academy of Sciences at the Abdus Salam Center for Theoretical Physics in Italy.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>2000</strong> - He received the Kazi Mahbubullah and Jebunnesa Medal in 2000.
			</li>
			
			<li>

			</li>
			
			<li>
				<strong>2013</strong> - He died on March 17, 2013 at a private hospital in Chittagong at the age of 84 due to a lung infection and heart disease.

				"I know everyone is still mourning Professor Stephen Hawking, but Professor JNI was also a larger-than-life figure. It is unfortunate that many people in Bangladesh don't know about him. In my mind, Hawking's greatest achievement was helping fund and create the Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS)â€”the largest mathematics department in the world. Professor JNI did something similar, although he didn't receive the acclaim and support that Hawking received. He established a centre, the Research Center for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (RCMPS), the only such centre in all of Bangladesh. This is an incredible achievement, a nation-building achievement."
